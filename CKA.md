# **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Practice Questions**

## **1. Cluster Architecture, Installation & Configuration**
### **1.1 Check Kubernetes Version**
**Command:**
```sh
kubectl version --short
```

### **1.2 Create a Kubernetes Cluster using Kubeadm**
**Steps:**
1. Install dependencies (`kubeadm`, `kubelet`, `kubectl`)
2. Initialize the control plane:
   ```sh
   kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16
   ```
3. Configure `kubectl` access:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
   cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
   chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
   ```
4. Install a network plugin (e.g., Calico, Flannel)
5. Join worker nodes using the `kubeadm join` command from step 2.

### **1.3 Upgrade the Cluster from v1.27 to v1.28**
**Steps:**
```sh
kubectl drain <node> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data

kubectl expose pod nginx --type=NodePort --port=80 --name=nginx-service
```

### **3.3 Troubleshoot Pod Communication Issues**
**Commands:**
```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl get networkpolicy
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh
```

---

## **4. Storage**
### **4.1 Create a Persistent Volume (PV)**
**YAML File:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-volume
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

### **4.2 Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**

# 6. Theoretical Knowledge Questions

### 6.1 Kubernetes Basics

What are the key components of the Kubernetes control plane?Answer: The control plane includes kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, etcd, and cloud-controller-manager (if applicable).

What is the difference between a Deployment and a StatefulSet?Answer: A Deployment is used for stateless applications and manages replicas, whereas a StatefulSet is used for stateful applications and ensures unique, stable network identities for each pod.

How does a ReplicaSet ensure high availability?Answer: It ensures the desired number of pod replicas are always running by creating new pods if any fail.

What is the difference between kubectl apply and kubectl create?Answer: kubectl apply is used for declarative updates, while kubectl create is used for imperative creation of resources.

### 6.2 Cluster Management

Explain the role of kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, and kube-controller-manager.Answer: kube-apiserver handles API requests, kube-scheduler assigns pods to nodes, and kube-controller-manager runs controllers to maintain cluster state.

What happens during a kubeadm init command?Answer: It initializes the control plane, generates certificates, starts control plane components, and sets up the cluster configuration.

How does Kubernetes handle leader election for HA control plane setups?Answer: Kubernetes uses etcd and leader election algorithms in kube-controller-manager to ensure only one leader is active at a time.

What is the function of kubelet and kube-proxy?Answer: kubelet runs on nodes to ensure containers are running, while kube-proxy manages network rules for service communication.

### 6.3 Networking

What are the different types of Kubernetes services?Answer: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName.

How does Kubernetes manage DNS resolution internally?Answer: Kubernetes uses CoreDNS to provide internal DNS resolution for services and pods.

What is a NetworkPolicy, and how does it work?Answer: A NetworkPolicy controls pod communication using rules based on labels, namespaces, and IP blocks.

What is the role of coredns in a Kubernetes cluster?Answer: It provides DNS resolution for service discovery within the cluster.

### 6.4 Storage & Volumes

What are the differences between Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)?Answer: PVs are storage resources in a cluster, while PVCs are requests for storage by applications.

How does dynamic volume provisioning work in Kubernetes?Answer: Kubernetes automatically provisions storage volumes based on PVC requests using storage classes.

What are the different access modes for Persistent Volumes?Answer: ReadWriteOnce (RWO), ReadOnlyMany (ROX), ReadWriteMany (RWX).

### 6.5 Security & Troubleshooting

What are Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles?Answer: RBAC roles define permissions for users and groups to access resources in a Kubernetes cluster.

How can you restrict a pod from running as a root user?Answer: Use PodSecurityPolicies or SecurityContext with runAsNonRoot: true.

How do you troubleshoot a pod that is stuck in ContainerCreating state?Answer: Check pod events (kubectl describe pod), storage issues, or node status.

What are taints and tolerations, and how do they affect scheduling?Answer: Taints prevent pods from running on a node unless a toleration allows it.
